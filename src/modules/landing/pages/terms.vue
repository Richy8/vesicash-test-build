            specific payment transactions you have asked us to make. As all
            funds that are in your account relate to pending payment
            transactions, your account is not accessible to you and you cannot
            ask us to deal with the funds other than by amending or cancelling
            your payment order for that payment transaction. Your login details

              to on-board them to the Vesicash platform. Once those steps are
              complete, we will confirm that you should fund your account for an
              amount equal to the amount of the proposed payment transaction.

              and/or such other funding mechanisms we may make available. It is
              important that you provide funds exactly equal to the proposed
              payment transaction (including escrow service charges) – no more,
              no less. You will not have completed a valid payment order until
              we have credited the funds corresponding to that payment
              transaction to your account. Funds received by us after 6pm
              (Nigerian Time) will be credited to your account the following

          <div class="content-text">
            <div class="margin-24">
              When initiating a transaction on the Vesicash platform, users are
              asked to determine the procedure by which they will resolve any
              dispute or misunderstanding that may arise during the course of
              the transaction. This procedure comes into effect once a dispute
              is initiated during a transaction and the transaction funds will
              remain in the escrow account until the dispute is mutually
              resolved between the transacting parties. Dispute resolution
              procedure available to users of the Vesicash platform are as
              follows:
            </div>

            <ul>
              <li class="margin-24">
                <span class="roobert-700">Mutual resolution:</span> If this
                option is selected by the user when initiating a transaction,
                should the event of a dispute arise, the transaction will be in
                a state of “In Dispute” until both parties have come to an
                agreement over the resolution, and have marked the transaction
                as completed or have mutually agreed to cancel the transaction
                in which case the funds are returned to the Paying Party. While
                the transaction is in this state, the transaction funds will
                remain securely held in the transactional escrow account.
              </li>

              <li class="margin-32">
                <span class="roobert-700">Third-party Resolution:</span> Third
                party alternative dispute resolution procedures may be required
                for certain transactions. However, this option may be made
                available (at the discretion of Vesicash) only for transactions
                above a stated value threshold. If users agree to this option
                when initiating a transaction, should the event of a dispute
                arise, if the transaction is in the “In Dispute” state, the
                details of the transaction will be forwarded to a neutral third
                party recommended or selected by Vesicash. Such neutral third
                parties include alternate dispute resolution officials, licensed
                by a professional body in Nigeria such as LCA and the Institute
                of Chartered Mediators. The fees payable to mediators would
                depend on several factors, including the complexity and
                technicality of the dispute, the time involved in settling the
                dispute as well as the number of mediators with the level of
                experience to handle the dispute in relation to that subject
                matter within the relevant jurisdiction. Mediator’s fees will be
                borne by the transacting parties and are negotiated between the
                parties and mediator at their discretion. Once an agreement has
                been reached by the parties, the Terms of Settlement are reduced
                into writing and this constitutes a binding and enforceable
                contract. Once this is achieved, the transaction funds are
                released according to this decision, after which the transaction
                is closed. While the transaction is in the “In Dispute” state,
                the transaction funds will remain securely held in the
                transactional escrow account.
